Integration test for vector store citation extraction functionality.

This test verifies that citations are properly extracted from FileSearch tool calls
when include_search_results=True is set on agents with files_folder configuration.

Key distinction: This tests VECTOR STORE citations (via FileSearch tool with files_folder),
not direct file attachment citations which are tested separately.
