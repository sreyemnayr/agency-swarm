"""
Test suite for verifying the combination of handoffs and communication flows in Agency Swarm.

Key Implementation Findings:
============================

1. **Communication Flows (SendMessage tools)**:
   - Agency creates specific tools named like `send_message_to_AgentB` for each communication flow
   - These are actual FunctionTool instances added to the sender agent's tools list
   - Control returns to the calling agent after receiving a response (orchestrator pattern)

2. **Handoffs (OpenAI SDK)**:
   - Handoffs are configured via the `handoffs` attribute on Agent instances
   - They do NOT create tools in Agency Swarm - handled directly by the OpenAI Agents SDK
   - Handoffs represent unidirectional transfer of control (agent B takes over from agent A)

3. **Expected Tool Configuration**:
   - AgentA (orchestrator): `send_message_to_AgentB`, `send_message_to_AgentC`
   - AgentB (with handoffs): No tools for handoffs (SDK handles), but retains handoffs attribute
   - AgentC (specialist): No communication tools

4. **Combining Both Patterns**:
   - Communication flows and handoffs can coexist on the same agent
   - Agency preserves the handoffs attribute during configuration
   - SendMessage tools are created based on communication_flows parameter
   - Handoffs functionality is preserved for the OpenAI SDK to handle
